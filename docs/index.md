- The aggregated compulsory third party liability data contains $2119$ cars with $4804$ years-at-risk and $1059$ claims. The empirical claims frequency is $0.22$. The claims frequency data of cars is saved as `car_compulsory.csv`.

- The claims frequency data of commercial policies is saved as `policy_commercial.csv`. In the claims frequency analysis we may just study the claims frequency of TPL and property and treat the other coverages as risk factors.
